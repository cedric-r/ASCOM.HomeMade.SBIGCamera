# ASCOM.HomeMade.SBIGCamera

This is an ASCOM driver for SBIG cameras. My main target camera is STF-8300, so it might not work for anything else.

As SBIG has veeb bought by Diffraction Limited and that they have decided not to invest time to develop ASCOM drivers for old cameras, SBIG owners hqave been left out in the cold. We're limited to the software that natively understands SBIG cameras, which exclude most recent software (e.g. Voyager, NINA).

So I decided to build my own. 

This work uses SbigSharp code written by eliotg (https://github.com/eliotg/SbigSharp).
